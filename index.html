    To display an HTML page correctly, a web browser must know which
    character set (character encoding) to use.
    UTF-8 (Unicode) covers almost all of the characters
    and symbols in the world; and works perfectly with HTML5.
  -->
  <!-- The HTML5 Standard: Unicode UTF-8
Because the character sets in ISO-8859 was limited in size, and not compatible in multilingual environments,
the Unicode Consortium developed the Unicode Standard.
The Unicode Standard covers (almost) all the characters, punctuations, and symbols in the world.
Unicode enables processing, storage, and transport of text independent of platform and language.

The default character encoding in HTML-5 is UTF-8.
If an HTML5 web page uses a different character set than UTF-8, it should be specified in the <meta> tag like:

Example:
<meta charset="ISO-8859-1">
-->
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <!-- The Difference Between Unicode and UTF-8
Unicode is a character set. UTF-8 is encoding.
Unicode is a list of characters with unique decimal numbers (code points). A = 65, B = 66, C = 67, ....
This list of decimal numbers represent the string "hello": 104 101 108 108 111
Encoding is how these numbers are translated into binary numbers to be stored in a computer:
UTF-8 encoding will store "hello" like this (binary): 01101000 01100101 01101100 01101100  01101111

Character sets translates those characters into numbers.
Encoding translates those numbers into binary code.

<!-- Broswers will actually ignore white-space so in order to format it so that it
won't in regards to text and such. Use these element tags:
<p> for paragraphs
Which allows for separation of line spacing above and below it to the browser.

You can also for visual purposes put place-filler text inside a <p> tag by typing:
lorem   Then press 'tab'

If you want to move some text content that's on the same line to be right below:
<br> for 'break'.

  If you type in a folder name, thats the equivalent
  of GO INSIDE THE FOLDER: foldername/

  filename  #If you simply type a file name it's to use a file

  ../
  The above method leaves the current folder and goes up to parent folder.
