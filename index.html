  If you type in a folder name, thats the equivalent
  of GO INSIDE THE FOLDER: foldername/
  versus:
  filename  #If you simply type a file name it's to use a file
  in the same directory, or the current directory that we're in.
  ../
  The above method leaves the current folder and goes up to parent folder.
